# 3-Columns-cars

## My process
This was extremely fun to do. I understood how to use grid better after doing this challenge. To have fun, I added a little animation to my cars, it is simple enough but I love it nonetheless. I took my time visualizing it, using divs inside of divs finally made sense to my brain and how to apply it.
